# Managing off-chain assets

You may be wondering how a DAO is going to manage off-chain assets like IP. To facilitate the day-to-day operations of managing a franchise as large as LotR, we will be establishing a non-profit organization who's charter is to implement the resolutions passed by the DAO. In this way, we will provide a legal framework for DAO members to participate in the governing of the organization, while also providing an off-chain legal entity that is obligated to the will of the DAO.&#x20;
