# Why now?

## The opportunity

As you may have read about [here ](https://gizmodo.com/got-2-billion-you-could-own-the-lord-of-the-rings-fil-1848508991)or [here](https://variety.com/2022/film/news/lord-of-the-rings-hobbit-tolkien-zaentz-rights-sale-1235176036/), the rights to the Lord of the Rings franchise are expected to go up for sale sometime this year. This is the first time since the 1970's that these are expected to be available on the open market, and we think this is a great opportunity to bring a beloved franchise, and also introduce a large and enthusiastic audience, to Web3.
