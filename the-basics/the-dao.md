# The DAO

We've all seen what the consolidation of IP and entertainment franchises has become. Fan made content is frequently squashed under the guise of protecting IP, and companies file thousands of DMCA takedown requests over legitimate fair use. While we won't be tackling the entire system, we think bringing the IP of a popular franchise to be managed under a DAO is a great first step to illustrate another way forward.&#x20;

### What is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?

DAOs are an effective and safe way to work with like-minded folks around the globe.

Think of them like an internet-native business that's collectively owned and managed by its members. They have built-in treasuries that no one has the authority to access without the approval of the group. Decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice.

There's no CEO who can authorize spending based on their own whims and no chance of a dodgy CFO manipulating the books. Everything is out in the open and the rules around spending are baked into the DAO via its code.
