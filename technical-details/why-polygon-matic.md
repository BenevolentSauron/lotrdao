# Why Polygon (MATIC)?

### Why Polygon?

1. EVM compatible and based on Solidity.
2. Low Gas fees.
3. With support from several large exchanges, exposure to a large number of onramps to make it easy for people new to Crypto/Web3 to get involved.

### Why not \<insert chain here> (i.e. Solana)?

We are open to proposals for other chains when we form the official DAO. While Solana is certainly intriguing, the team was not familiar with Rust and recent performance issues were a concern.
