# The Goal

While the ultimate stretch goal is to raise enough capital to purchase the entire portfolio of Movie and Game rights that will be put up for auction, we realize that is a tremendous amount of money to raise in a relatively short period of time. Therefore, outlined below are incremental goals to provide an achievable roadmap, with some planning for outsized success that Web3 has been known to achieve now and then.

### Obtain and official license to develop a Web3 game in the Lord of the Rings setting.

The minimum bar for success. Lets build Middle-Earth in the Metaverse!

### Stretch Goal #1 - All Game Rights

By acquiring the full gaming rights, we can help LotR themed games and content flourish on the web instead of being subject to takedown notices.&#x20;

### Stretch Goal #2 - Additional Merchandising and Live Event Rights

Beyond the initial video game rights, acquire additional rights to support the larger ecosystem to, for example, host LotR themed events and Cons.

### Ultimate Stretch Goal - All Available Rights

The holy grail, or One Ring, of stretch goals. In the event this effort exceeds our wildest dreams, acquire all available rights and show the world how a property can be managed in an ethical and equitable way by the people who cherish it the most.

### Plan B - What if we fail to acquire any rights?

While we can hope for the best, it's always possible that for any number of reasons we fail to acquire the necessary rights to build a viable product, or any rights at all for that matter. In that event, initially we see two possible outcomes but as always the DAO will entertain other proposals as well:

1. Liquidate the treasury and divide the assets amongst the token holders.
2. Vote on and agree to proceed with an original IP in the spirit of the original material. In this scenario, we would likely offer an exit opportunity to any holders that aren't interested in the new IP to ensure all DAO members are invested in the success of the project.
