# The Roadmap

### Phase 0 - Inception

This phase consists of the launch of the initial Website, Discord, and V1 Token. This phase is intended to build a community to help finalize the structure of the DAO, raise funds for the formation of the non-profit, and refine the goals and objectives of the DAO.  This is an opportunity for people who are passionate about Lord of the Rings, and/or Web3, to get involved and invest things other than capital to participate in the DAO. While we expect/need some funds for the off-chain activities, the primary deliverables of this phase will be the launch of the on-chain DAO, a refined website, active moderators/participants in the Discord, and an active community on socials to prepare us for our Launch.

### Phase 1 - Launch

This is our funding phase. Phase 1 will primarily be about raising enough capital to actually acquire a license for LotR content. How much we raise in this phase will directly impact our goals and if we have the ability to hit any of our stretch goals.&#x20;

With our DAO in place, we'll launch our V2 token along with any additional governance tokens as determined in Phase 0.&#x20;

### Phase 3 - Purchase

Once we have raised enough capital to actually  purchase a license, we will establish our non-profit to carry out the purchase. More details on the structure of this to be clarified during Phase 0.
