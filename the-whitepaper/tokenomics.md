# Tokenomics

### V1 Token

The initial token is intentionally uncapped, and available to mint via the website. This token will also be distributed as contribution awards to members of the community, and is not intended to raise a large amount of capital. This token will be converted 1:1 to the V2 token at the launch of the DAO.&#x20;

To reward our early adopters, tokens will be minted at a discounted/accelerated rate compared to V2 (estimated 10x to 100x, subject to change).&#x20;

### V2 Token

This will be the native token for the LotR DAO and will provide the primary source of funds for the DAO's objectives. Details to be added as Phase 0 progresses.

### Governance Tokens

It is possible that the V2 token will also provide the governance mechanism for the DAO, however we want to raise the possibility of a separate governance token to differentiate between a passive stakeholder and an active participant  in the governance of the DAO.
