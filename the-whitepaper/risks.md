# Risks

It goes without saying that any Web3 project inherently has some risk attached to it. In Phase 0, the funds will be concentrated in a single contract, which will be centrally controlled. This is the primary reason that Phase 0 is not intended to be a fundraising phase, as the formation of the DAO and distributed control of the treasury is a primary deliverable of the initial phase, and required to move to Phase 1 and public launch.&#x20;

Having said that, this is in principal no different than other crowdfunding platforms such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter. While these platforms do some review of projects, they claim no responsibility for them and fraud or non-delivery of product is a very real risk.&#x20;

We encourage you to join our community and get to know us. In phase 0, we want enthusiastic members first and foremost.&#x20;
